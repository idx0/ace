Another Chess Engine (ACE)
===

ACE is a simple bitboard based chess engine written in C.  The initial goal is to get a working engine that can play chess via a GUI application such as [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.com).  Eventually, I hope to expand and optimize the program.  Maybe one day it will even be able to compete for a decent ranking against other chess engines.
