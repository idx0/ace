Evaluation:
-----
 - Piece-Square tables, perhaps derived from analysis of real games.  Should
   have opening, midgame, lategame code.
 - Isolated & Passed pawns
 - Deep pawn evaluation (check for pawns which are deep across the board)
 - Material & Mobility
 - Pawn Hash table
 - King safety
 - Bishop/Knigh/Rook Pairs
 - Material draw & endgame
 - Baysian statistics???

Move Scoring:
-----
Moves are scored using a variety of techniques.  The most apparent is MvvLva,
which scores moves based on their capture ranking (PxQ being the best, QxP being
the worst).  However, killer moves (those which cause a beta cutoff) and history
moves (those which improve alpha) are also recorded.  Finally, there is extra
value added for the type of move.  For example, a castle is better than a quiet
move.  Quiet pawn promotion is also rewarded.  The breakdown looks as follows:

	0 - 8191	history scores
	9000+		killer moves
	10000+		special moves & captures
	20000		branch cutoffs via transposition table

I hope to add SEE somewhere into this formula, probably from 15000 onward.

These values are assigned to moves during move generation (or during search for
transposition table hits).  In order to order moves during search.
